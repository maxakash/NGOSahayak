The purpose of the system is to provide an interface to NGO's as well as government bodies through which they can communicate with each other. The proposed solution is an Android App which allows NGO's to register and get verified by Government organisation. On Successfull Verfication of the NGO by Government bodies they would be able to request permissions for various events and also request for funds for organising events. The governmental bodies login portal will enable them to invite applications to help central government funded projects and also enable them to monitor NGO's activities.
